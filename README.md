NC-GAMES is a robust web application that provides a comprehensive database of board game reviews and information. The app allows users to interact with the database by voting and commenting on the reviews, as well as filtering the reviews and games by date, comments, and votes. 
<br>
<br>
The application is built using modern web technologies, including React for the front-end, and Node.js and Express for the back-end. The back-end is designed as a RESTful API, which allows for easy communication between the client and server. The API is hosted on Netlify and uses a PostgreSQL database to store the game reviews and user information.

For testing purposes, users of this app may log in as a default user, but any user is accessible.
